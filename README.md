# Members Only!

This is part of the Authentication Project in The Odin Project‚Äôs Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication

In this project, We built an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.


## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/od-c0d3r/members-only.git
$ cd members-only
```

Then install the needed packages (while skipping any Ruby gems needed only in production):

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Branches

Simply check out the corresponding branch using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout <branch name>
```
